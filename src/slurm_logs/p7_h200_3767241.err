torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 20.12 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 139.81 GiB of which 15.34 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 124.47 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 123.81 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 66.65 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
