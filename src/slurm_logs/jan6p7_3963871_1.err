torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 20.48 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 139.81 GiB of which 2.58 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 137.22 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 136.20 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 357.50 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
